<h2 class="chapter">22 Testsuite</h2>

<p><a name="index-test-suite-492"></a>
The testsuite is an important component of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> package. 
While it is always worthwhile to encourage user testing, in practice
this is rarely sufficient; users typically use only a small subset of
the available commands, and it has proven all too common for a change
to cause a significant regression that went unnoticed for some time.

   <p>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> testsuite uses the DejaGNU testing framework.  The
tests themselves are calls to various <code>Tcl</code> procs; the framework
runs all the procs and summarizes the passes and fails.

<h3 class="section">22.1 Using the Testsuite</h3>

<p><a name="index-running-the-test-suite-493"></a>To run the testsuite, simply go to the <span class="sc">gdb</span> object directory (or to the
testsuite's objdir) and type <code>make check</code>.  This just sets up some
environment variables and invokes DejaGNU's <code>runtest</code> script.  While
the testsuite is running, you'll get mentions of which test file is in use,
and a mention of any unexpected passes or fails.  When the testsuite is
finished, you'll get a summary that looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">                     === gdb Summary ===
     
     # of expected passes            6016
     # of unexpected failures        58
     # of unexpected successes       5
     # of expected failures          183
     # of unresolved testcases       3
     # of untested testcases         5
</pre>
   <p>To run a specific test script, type:
<pre class="example">     make check RUNTESTFLAGS='<var>tests</var>'
</pre>
   <p>where <var>tests</var> is a list of test script file names, separated by
spaces.

   <p>If you use GNU make, you can use its <samp><span class="option">-j</span></samp> option to run the
testsuite in parallel.  This can greatly reduce the amount of time it
takes for the testsuite to run.  In this case, if you set
<code>RUNTESTFLAGS</code> then, by default, the tests will be run serially
even under <samp><span class="option">-j</span></samp>.  You can override this and force a parallel run
by setting the <code>make</code> variable <code>FORCE_PARALLEL</code> to any
non-empty value.  Note that the parallel <kbd>make check</kbd> assumes
that you want to run the entire testsuite, so it is not compatible
with some dejagnu options, like <samp><span class="option">--directory</span></samp>.

   <p>The ideal test run consists of expected passes only; however, reality
conspires to keep us from this ideal.  Unexpected failures indicate
real problems, whether in <span class="sc">gdb</span> or in the testsuite.  Expected
failures are still failures, but ones which have been decided are too
hard to deal with at the time; for instance, a test case might work
everywhere except on AIX, and there is no prospect of the AIX case
being fixed in the near future.  Expected failures should not be added
lightly, since you may be masking serious bugs in <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
Unexpected successes are expected fails that are passing for some
reason, while unresolved and untested cases often indicate some minor
catastrophe, such as the compiler being unable to deal with a test
program.

   <p>When making any significant change to <span class="sc">gdb</span>, you should run the
testsuite before and after the change, to confirm that there are no
regressions.  Note that truly complete testing would require that you
run the testsuite with all supported configurations and a variety of
compilers; however this is more than really necessary.  In many cases
testing with a single configuration is sufficient.  Other useful
options are to test one big-endian (Sparc) and one little-endian (x86)
host, a cross config with a builtin simulator (powerpc-eabi,
mips-elf), or a 64-bit host (Alpha).

   <p>If you add new functionality to <span class="sc">gdb</span>, please consider adding
tests for it as well; this way future <span class="sc">gdb</span> hackers can detect
and fix their changes that break the functionality you added. 
Similarly, if you fix a bug that was not previously reported as a test
failure, please add a test case for it.  Some cases are extremely
difficult to test, such as code that handles host OS failures or bugs
in particular versions of compilers, and it's OK not to try to write
tests for all of those.

   <p>DejaGNU supports separate build, host, and target machines.  However,
some <span class="sc">gdb</span> test scripts do not work if the build machine and
the host machine are not the same.  In such an environment, these scripts
will give a result of &ldquo;UNRESOLVED&rdquo;, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     UNRESOLVED: gdb.base/example.exp: This test script does not work on a remote host.
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">22.2 Testsuite Parameters</h3>

<p>Several variables exist to modify the behavior of the testsuite.

     <ul>
<li><code>TRANSCRIPT</code>

     <p>Sometimes it is convenient to get a transcript of the commands which
the testsuite sends to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  For example, if <span class="sc">gdb</span>
crashes during testing, a transcript can be used to more easily
reconstruct the failure when running <span class="sc">gdb</span> under <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <p>You can instruct the <span class="sc">gdb</span> testsuite to write transcripts by
setting the DejaGNU variable <code>TRANSCRIPT</code> (to any value)
before invoking <code>runtest</code> or <kbd>make check</kbd>.  The transcripts
will be written into DejaGNU's output directory.  One transcript will
be made for each invocation of <span class="sc">gdb</span>; they will be named
<samp><span class="file">transcript.</span><var>n</var></samp>, where <var>n</var> is an integer.  The first
line of the transcript file will show how <span class="sc">gdb</span> was invoked;
each subsequent line is a command sent as input to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          make check RUNTESTFLAGS=TRANSCRIPT=y
</pre>
     <p>Note that the transcript is not always complete.  In particular, tests
of completion can yield partial command lines.

     <li><code>GDB</code>

     <p>Sometimes one wishes to test a different <span class="sc">gdb</span> than the one in the build
directory.  For example, one may wish to run the testsuite on
<samp><span class="file">/usr/bin/gdb</span></samp>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          make check RUNTESTFLAGS=GDB=/usr/bin/gdb
</pre>
     <li><code>GDBSERVER</code>

     <p>When testing a different <span class="sc">gdb</span>, it is often useful to also test a
different gdbserver.

     <pre class="smallexample">          make check RUNTESTFLAGS="GDB=/usr/bin/gdb GDBSERVER=/usr/bin/gdbserver"
</pre>
     <li><code>INTERNAL_GDBFLAGS</code>

     <p>When running the testsuite normally one doesn't want whatever is in
<samp><span class="file">~/.gdbinit</span></samp> to interfere with the tests, therefore the test harness
passes <samp><span class="option">-nx</span></samp> to <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  One also doesn't want any windowed
version of <span class="sc">gdb</span>, e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gdb -tui</span></samp>&rsquo;, to run. 
This is achieved via <code>INTERNAL_GDBFLAGS</code>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          set INTERNAL_GDBFLAGS "-nw -nx"
</pre>
     <p>This is all well and good, except when testing an installed <span class="sc">gdb</span>
that has been configured with <samp><span class="option">--with-system-gdbinit</span></samp>.  Here one
does not want <samp><span class="file">~/.gdbinit</span></samp> loaded but one may want the system
<samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp> file loaded.  This can be achieved by pointing <code>$HOME</code>
at a directory without a <samp><span class="file">.gdbinit</span></samp> and by overriding
<code>INTERNAL_GDBFLAGS</code> and removing <samp><span class="option">-nx</span></samp>.

     <pre class="smallexample">          cd testsuite
          HOME=`pwd` runtest \
            GDB=/usr/bin/gdb \
            GDBSERVER=/usr/bin/gdbserver \
            INTERNAL_GDBFLAGS=-nw
</pre>
     </ul>

   <p>There are two ways to run the testsuite and pass additional parameters
to DejaGnu.  The first is with <kbd>make check</kbd> and specifying the
makefile variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RUNTESTFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<pre class="smallexample">     make check RUNTESTFLAGS=TRANSCRIPT=y
</pre>
   <p>The second is to cd to the <samp><span class="file">testsuite</span></samp> directory and invoke the DejaGnu
<samp><span class="command">runtest</span></samp> command directly.

<pre class="smallexample">     cd testsuite
     make site.exp
     runtest TRANSCRIPT=y
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">22.3 Testsuite Configuration</h3>

<p><a name="index-Testsuite-Configuration-494"></a>
It is possible to adjust the behavior of the testsuite by defining
the global variables listed below, either in a <samp><span class="file">site.exp</span></samp> file,
or in a board file.

     <ul>
<li><code>gdb_test_timeout</code>

     <p>Defining this variable changes the default timeout duration used during
communication with <span class="sc">gdb</span>.  More specifically, the global variable
used during testing is <code>timeout</code>, but this variable gets reset to
<code>gdb_test_timeout</code> at the beginning of each testcase, making sure
that any local change to <code>timeout</code> in a testcase does not affect
subsequent testcases.

     <p>This global variable comes in handy when the debugger is slower than
normal due to the testing environment, triggering unexpected <code>TIMEOUT</code>
test failures.  Examples include when testing on a remote machine, or
against a system where communications are slow.

     <p>If not specifically defined, this variable gets automatically defined
to the same value as <code>timeout</code> during the testsuite initialization. 
The default value of the timeout is defined in the file
<samp><span class="file">gdb/testsuite/config/unix.exp</span></samp> that is part of the <span class="sc">gdb</span>
test suite<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   </ul>

<h3 class="section">22.4 Testsuite Organization</h3>

<p><a name="index-test-suite-organization-495"></a>The testsuite is entirely contained in <samp><span class="file">gdb/testsuite</span></samp>.  While the
testsuite includes some makefiles and configury, these are very minimal,
and used for little besides cleaning up, since the tests themselves
handle the compilation of the programs that <span class="sc">gdb</span> will run.  The file
<samp><span class="file">testsuite/lib/gdb.exp</span></samp> contains common utility procs useful for
all <span class="sc">gdb</span> tests, while the directory <samp><span class="file">testsuite/config</span></samp> contains
configuration-specific files, typically used for special-purpose
definitions of procs like <code>gdb_load</code> and <code>gdb_start</code>.

   <p>The tests themselves are to be found in <samp><span class="file">testsuite/gdb.*</span></samp> and
subdirectories of those.  The names of the test files must always end
with <samp><span class="file">.exp</span></samp>.  DejaGNU collects the test files by wildcarding
in the test directories, so both subdirectories and individual files
get chosen and run in alphabetical order.

   <p>The following table lists the main types of subdirectories and what they
are for.  Since DejaGNU finds test files no matter where they are
located, and since each test file sets up its own compilation and
execution environment, this organization is simply for convenience and
intelligibility.

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="file">gdb.base</span></samp><dd>This is the base testsuite.  The tests in it should apply to all
configurations of <span class="sc">gdb</span> (but generic native-only tests may live here). 
The test programs should be in the subset of C that is valid K&amp;R,
ANSI/ISO, and C<tt>++</tt> (<code>#ifdef</code>s are allowed if necessary, for instance
for prototypes).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gdb.</span><var>lang</var></samp><dd>Language-specific tests for any language <var>lang</var> besides C.  Examples are
<samp><span class="file">gdb.cp</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">gdb.java</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gdb.</span><var>platform</var></samp><dd>Non-portable tests.  The tests are specific to a specific configuration
(host or target), such as HP-UX or eCos.  Example is <samp><span class="file">gdb.hp</span></samp>, for
HP-UX.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gdb.</span><var>compiler</var></samp><dd>Tests specific to a particular compiler.  As of this writing (June
1999), there aren't currently any groups of tests in this category that
couldn't just as sensibly be made platform-specific, but one could
imagine a <samp><span class="file">gdb.gcc</span></samp>, for tests of <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s handling of GCC
extensions.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="file">gdb.</span><var>subsystem</var></samp><dd>Tests that exercise a specific <span class="sc">gdb</span> subsystem in more depth.  For
instance, <samp><span class="file">gdb.disasm</span></samp> exercises various disassemblers, while
<samp><span class="file">gdb.stabs</span></samp> tests pathways through the stabs symbol reader. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">22.5 Writing Tests</h3>

<p><a name="index-writing-tests-496"></a>
In many areas, the <span class="sc">gdb</span> tests are already quite comprehensive; you
should be able to copy existing tests to handle new cases.

   <p>You should try to use <code>gdb_test</code> whenever possible, since it
includes cases to handle all the unexpected errors that might happen. 
However, it doesn't cost anything to add new test procedures; for
instance, <samp><span class="file">gdb.base/exprs.exp</span></samp> defines a <code>test_expr</code> that
calls <code>gdb_test</code> multiple times.

   <p>Only use <code>send_gdb</code> and <code>gdb_expect</code> when absolutely
necessary.  Even if <span class="sc">gdb</span> has several valid responses to
a command, you can use <code>gdb_test_multiple</code>.  Like <code>gdb_test</code>,
<code>gdb_test_multiple</code> recognizes internal errors and unexpected
prompts.

   <p>Do not write tests which expect a literal tab character from <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
On some operating systems (e.g. OpenBSD) the TTY layer expands tabs to
spaces, so by the time <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s output reaches expect the tab is gone.

   <p>The source language programs do <em>not</em> need to be in a consistent
style.  Since <span class="sc">gdb</span> is used to debug programs written in many different
styles, it's worth having a mix of styles in the testsuite; for
instance, some <span class="sc">gdb</span> bugs involving the display of source lines would
never manifest themselves if the programs used GNU coding style
uniformly.

   <p>Some testcase results need more detailed explanation:

     <dl>
<dt><code>KFAIL</code><dd>Known problem of <span class="sc">gdb</span> itself.  You must specify the <span class="sc">gdb</span> bug
report number like in these sample tests:
     <pre class="smallexample">          kfail "gdb/13392" "continue to marker 2"
</pre>
     <p>or
     <pre class="smallexample">          setup_kfail gdb/13392 "*-*-*"
          kfail "continue to marker 2"
</pre>
     <br><dt><code>XFAIL</code><dd>Known problem of environment.  This typically includes <span class="sc">gcc</span> but it
includes also many other system components which cannot be fixed in the
<span class="sc">gdb</span> project.  Sample test with sanity check not knowing the specific
cause of the problem:
     <pre class="smallexample">          # On x86_64 it is commonly about 4MB.
          if {$stub_size &gt; 25000000} {
              xfail "stub size $stub_size is too large"
              return
          }
</pre>
     <p>You should provide bug report number for the failing component of the
environment, if such bug report is available:
     <pre class="smallexample">          if {[test_compiler_info {gcc-[0-3]-*}]
             || [test_compiler_info {gcc-4-[0-5]-*}]} {
             setup_xfail "gcc/46955" *-*-*
          }
          gdb_test "python print ttype.template_argument(2)" "&amp;C::c"
</pre>
     </dl>

<h3 class="section">22.6 Board settings</h3>

<p>In <span class="sc">gdb</span> testsuite, the tests can be configured or customized in the board
file by means of <dfn>Board Settings</dfn>.  Each setting   should be consulted by
test cases that depend on the corresponding feature.

   <p>Here are the supported board settings:

     <dl>
<dt><code>gdb,cannot_call_functions</code><dd>The board does not support inferior call, that is, invoking inferior functions
in <span class="sc">gdb</span>. 
<br><dt><code>gdb,can_reverse</code><dd>The board supports reverse execution. 
<br><dt><code>gdb,no_hardware_watchpoints</code><dd>The board does not support hardware watchpoints. 
<br><dt><code>gdb,nofileio</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> is unable to intercept target file operations in remote and perform
them on the host. 
<br><dt><code>gdb,noinferiorio</code><dd>The board is unable to provide I/O capability to the inferior. 
<!-- @item gdb,noresults -->
<!-- NEED DOCUMENT. -->
<br><dt><code>gdb,nosignals</code><dd>The board does not support signals. 
<br><dt><code>gdb,skip_huge_test</code><dd>Skip time-consuming tests on the board with slow connection. 
<br><dt><code>gdb,skip_float_tests</code><dd>Skip tests related to float points on target board. 
<br><dt><code>gdb,use_precord</code><dd>The board supports process record. 
<br><dt><code>gdb_server_prog</code><dd>The location of GDBserver.  If GDBserver somewhere other than its default
location is used in test, specify the location of GDBserver in this variable. 
The location is a file name of GDBserver that can be either absolute or
relative to testsuite subdirectory in build directory. 
<br><dt><code>in_proc_agent</code><dd>The location of in-process agent.  If in-process agent other than its default
location is used in test, specify the location of in-process agent in
this variable.  The location is a file name of in-process agent that can be
either  absolute or relative to testsuite subdirectory in build directory. 
<br><dt><code>noargs</code><dd><span class="sc">gdb</span> does not support argument passing for inferior. 
<br><dt><code>no_long_long</code><dd>The board does not support type <code>long long</code>. 
<!-- @item use_cygmon -->
<!-- NEED DOCUMENT. -->
<br><dt><code>use_gdb_stub</code><dd>The tests are running with gdb stub.
