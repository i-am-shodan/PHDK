<h2 class="chapter">7 Stack Frames</h2>

<p><a name="index-frame-106"></a><a name="index-call-stack-frame-107"></a>A frame is a construct that <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses to keep track of calling
and called functions.

   <p><a name="index-unwind-frame-108"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span>'s frame model, a fresh design, was implemented with the
need to support <span class="sc">dwarf</span>'s Call Frame Information in mind.  In fact,
the term &ldquo;unwind&rdquo; is taken directly from that specification. 
Developers wishing to learn more about unwinders, are encouraged to
read the <span class="sc">dwarf</span> specification, available from
<a href="http://www.dwarfstd.org">http://www.dwarfstd.org</a>.

   <p><a name="index-frame_005fregister_005funwind-109"></a><a name="index-get_005fframe_005fregister-110"></a><span class="sc">gdb</span>'s model is that you find a frame's registers by
&ldquo;unwinding&rdquo; them from the next younger frame.  That is,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">get_frame_register</span></samp>&rsquo; which returns the value of a register in
frame #1 (the next-to-youngest frame), is implemented by calling frame
#0's <code>frame_register_unwind</code> (the youngest frame).  But then the
obvious question is: how do you access the registers of the youngest
frame itself?

   <p><a name="index-sentinel-frame-111"></a><a name="index-get_005fframe_005ftype-112"></a><a name="index-SENTINEL_005fFRAME-113"></a>To answer this question, <span class="sc">gdb</span> has the <dfn>sentinel</dfn> frame, the
&ldquo;-1st&rdquo; frame.  Unwinding registers from the sentinel frame gives you
the current values of the youngest real frame's registers.  If <var>f</var>
is a sentinel frame, then <code>get_frame_type (</code><var>f</var><code>) ==
SENTINEL_FRAME</code>.

<h3 class="section">7.1 Selecting an Unwinder</h3>

<p><a name="index-frame_005funwind_005fprepend_005funwinder-114"></a><a name="index-frame_005funwind_005fappend_005funwinder-115"></a>The architecture registers a list of frame unwinders (<code>struct
frame_unwind</code>), using the functions
<code>frame_unwind_prepend_unwinder</code> and
<code>frame_unwind_append_unwinder</code>.  Each unwinder includes a
sniffer.  Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> needs to unwind a frame (to fetch the
previous frame's registers or the current frame's ID), it calls
registered sniffers in order to find one which recognizes the frame. 
The first time a sniffer returns non-zero, the corresponding unwinder
is assigned to the frame.

<h3 class="section">7.2 Unwinding the Frame ID</h3>

<p><a name="index-frame-ID-116"></a>
Every frame has an associated ID, of type <code>struct frame_id</code>. 
The ID includes the stack base and function start address for
the frame.  The ID persists through the entire life of the frame,
including while other called frames are running; it is used to
locate an appropriate <code>struct frame_info</code> from the cache.

   <p>Every time the inferior stops, and at various other times, the frame
cache is flushed.  Because of this, parts of <span class="sc">gdb</span> which need
to keep track of individual frames cannot use pointers to <code>struct
frame_info</code>.  A frame ID provides a stable reference to a frame, even
when the unwinder must be run again to generate a new <code>struct
frame_info</code> for the same frame.

   <p>The frame's unwinder's <code>this_id</code> method is called to find the ID. 
Note that this is different from register unwinding, where the next
frame's <code>prev_register</code> is called to unwind this frame's
registers.

   <p>Both stack base and function address are required to identify the
frame, because a recursive function has the same function address for
two consecutive frames and a leaf function may have the same stack
address as its caller.  On some platforms, a third address is part of
the ID to further disambiguate frames&mdash;for instance, on IA-64
the separate register stack address is included in the ID.

   <p>An invalid frame ID (<code>outer_frame_id</code>) returned from the
<code>this_id</code> method means to stop unwinding after this frame.

   <p><code>null_frame_id</code> is another invalid frame ID which should be used
when there is no frame.  For instance, certain breakpoints are attached
to a specific frame, and that frame is identified through its frame ID
(we use this to implement the "finish" command).  Using
<code>null_frame_id</code> as the frame ID for a given breakpoint means
that the breakpoint is not specific to any frame.  The <code>this_id</code>
method should never return <code>null_frame_id</code>.

<h3 class="section">7.3 Unwinding Registers</h3>

<p>Each unwinder includes a <code>prev_register</code> method.  This method
takes a frame, an associated cache pointer, and a register number. 
It returns a <code>struct value *</code> describing the requested register,
as saved by this frame.  This is the value of the register that is
current in this frame's caller.

   <p>The returned value must have the same type as the register.  It may
have any lvalue type.  In most circumstances one of these routines
will generate the appropriate value:

     <dl>
<dt><code>frame_unwind_got_optimized</code><dd><a name="index-frame_005funwind_005fgot_005foptimized-117"></a>This register was not saved.

     <br><dt><code>frame_unwind_got_register</code><dd><a name="index-frame_005funwind_005fgot_005fregister-118"></a>This register was copied into another register in this frame.  This
is also used for unchanged registers; they are &ldquo;copied&rdquo; into the
same register.

     <br><dt><code>frame_unwind_got_memory</code><dd><a name="index-frame_005funwind_005fgot_005fmemory-119"></a>This register was saved in memory.

     <br><dt><code>frame_unwind_got_constant</code><dd><a name="index-frame_005funwind_005fgot_005fconstant-120"></a>This register was not saved, but the unwinder can compute the previous
value some other way.

     <br><dt><code>frame_unwind_got_address</code><dd><a name="index-frame_005funwind_005fgot_005faddress-121"></a>Same as <code>frame_unwind_got_constant</code>, except that the value is a target
address.  This is frequently used for the stack pointer, which is not
explicitly saved but has a known offset from this frame's stack
pointer.  For architectures with a flat unified address space, this is
generally the same as <code>frame_unwind_got_constant</code>.
