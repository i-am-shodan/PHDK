<h3 class="section">1.2 Contributors</h3>

<p>The first edition of this document was written by John Gilmore of
Cygnus Solutions. The current second edition was written by Stan Shebs
of Cygnus Solutions, who continues to update the manual.

   <p>Over the years, many others have made additions and changes to this
document. This section attempts to record the significant contributors
to that effort. One of the virtues of free software is that everyone
is free to contribute to it; with regret, we cannot actually
acknowledge everyone here.

   <blockquote>
<em>Plea:</em> This section has only been added relatively recently (four
years after publication of the second edition). Additions to this
section are particularly welcome.  If you or your friends (or enemies,
to be evenhanded) have been unfairly omitted from this list, we would
like to add your names! 
</blockquote>

   <p>A document such as this relies on being kept up to date by numerous
small updates by contributing engineers as they make changes to the
code base. The file <samp><span class="file">ChangeLog</span></samp> in the <span class="sc">gdb</span> distribution
approximates a blow-by-blow account. The most prolific contributors to
this important, but low profile task are Andrew Cagney (responsible
for over half the entries), Daniel Jacobowitz, Mark Kettenis, Jim
Blandy and Eli Zaretskii.

   <p>Eli Zaretskii and Daniel Jacobowitz wrote the sections documenting
watchpoints.

   <p>Jeremy Bennett updated the sections on initializing a new architecture
and register representation, and added the section on Frame Interpretation.
