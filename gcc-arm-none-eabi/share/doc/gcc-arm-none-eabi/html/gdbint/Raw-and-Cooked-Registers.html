<span class="sc">gdb</span> considers registers to be a set with members numbered
linearly from 0 upwards.  The first part of that set corresponds to real
physical registers, the second part to any <dfn>pseudo-registers</dfn>. 
Pseudo-registers have no independent physical existence, but are useful
representations of information within the architecture.  For example the
OpenRISC 1000 architecture has up to 32 general purpose registers, which
are typically represented as 32-bit (or 64-bit) integers.  However the
GPRs are also used as operands to the floating point operations, and it
could be convenient to define a set of pseudo-registers, to show the
GPRs represented as floating point values.

   <p>For any architecture, the implementer will decide on a mapping from
hardware to <span class="sc">gdb</span> register numbers.  The registers corresponding to real
hardware are referred to as <dfn>raw</dfn> registers, the remaining registers are
<dfn>pseudo-registers</dfn>.  The total register set (raw and pseudo) is called
the <dfn>cooked</dfn> register set.
